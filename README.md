# MediQueue - Hospital Queue Management System

A full-stack web application designed to streamline hospital appointment scheduling and reduce patient waiting times through real-time queue management.

## What it does

MediQueue helps hospitals manage patient flow more efficiently. Patients can book appointments online, check their queue position in real-time, and receive notifications when it's their turn. Doctors get a clean dashboard to manage their appointments, and admins can oversee the entire system.

## Built with

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Notifications:** Nodemailer for email alerts

## Key features

- Role-based access for patients, doctors, and admin
- Real-time queue position tracking
- Automated email notifications
- Appointment booking and management
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Why I built this

After seeing long waiting times at hospitals and patients not knowing when they'd be called, I wanted to create something that could make the experience better for everyone involved. This project combines my interest in healthcare technology with full-stack development.
